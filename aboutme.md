Welcome to my website ! My name is Damien and I'm currently data analyst at the Agence Nationale de la Recherche. I am also graduated in biomedical engineering applied to neuroscience from the [BME](https://www.bme-paris.com/) master. You can check my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natsunami/website/master/_data/Isai%20Damien%20CV%20FR%20Data%20Analyst%20Scientist%202021.pdf) just right here !

I have background in [Cognitive Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) which is a multidisciplinary field that mix neuroscience, psychology, computer sciences, physics and mathematics. In fact, i'm passionate about the humain mind and its complexity. During my studies, I was particularly interested in machine learning to understand how a machine could mimic human intelligence which explained why I decided to go into engineering. I developed skills in data science that i could applied during my internships at [Neurospin](https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/Pages/Entites_de_recherche/NeuroSpin.aspx).

Since I graduated I chose to devote myself fully to data science and to work on a multitude of projects which explain why I created this site :)
You will find articles but also all of my projects in the section portfolio. 

If you wanna contact me for anything, feel free to send me a mail or a  message on linkdin ! :)
