Welcome to my website ! My name is Damien and i'm graduated in biomedical engineering for neurosciences from the [BME](https://www.bme-paris.com/) master. Here is my [CV] ! 

I have background in [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) which is a multidisciplinary field that mix neuroscience, psychology, computer sciences, physics and mathematics. In fact i'm passionate about the humain mind and its complexity. During my studies, I was particularly interested in machine learning to understand how a machine could mimic human intelligence which explained why I decided to go into engineering. I developed skills in data science that i could applied during my internships at Neurospin(https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/Pages/Entites_de_recherche/NeuroSpin.aspx)

since I graduated I chose to devote myself fully to data science and to work on a multitude of projects, that's why I created this site :)
You will find on this website articles that i post on my linkedin but also all the projects. 

If you wanna contact me for anything, feel free to send me a mail or a  message on linkdin ! :)
